# Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis  
要求使用CNN与RNN完成Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis。此处我分别使用Gated CNN(GCAE)与AOA-LSTM。 


This task is based on subtask 2 of SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis. http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/

For example:    
“Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high”.  
This sentence contains two aspects, namely “seafood” and “prices”. The sentiment for the two aspects are positive and negative respectively.
